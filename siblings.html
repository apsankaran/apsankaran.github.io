				<p>This page is dedicated to my siblings, Anushka Sankaran and Junior. Anushka is my younger sister, she is 16 and a junior in high school. Anushka and I are very close and I talk to her everyday from college. Fun <b>fact</b> about her, she was the inferior sibling, is still the inferior sibling, and will always be the inferior sibling. Junior is our dog, he is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. We got him as a puppy and he turned six years old this year. Fun fact about Junior, he LOVES food. I love them both. Here are some pictures of them!</p>
